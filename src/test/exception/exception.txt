* Checked Exception
   The classes that extend Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions
   e.g.SQLException
       IOException
       ClassNotFoundException
       InvocationTargetException etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.

* Unchecked Exception
  The classes that extend RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions
  e.g. NullPointerException
       ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
       ArithmeticException
       IllegalArgumentException
       NumberFormatException etc.
  Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time rather they are checked at runtime.

*  Error
    Error is irrecoverable e.g. OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc.

--> The JVM firstly checks whether the exception is handled or not. If exception is not handled, JVM provides a default exception

************************
The Java throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.

We can throw either checked or uncheked exception in java by throw keyword.
The throw keyword is mainly used to throw custom exception. We will see custom exceptions later.


**************************************

Java Exception propagation :
An exception is first thrown from the top of the stack and if it is not caught,
    it drops down the call stack to the previous method,If not caught there,
        the exception again drops down to the previous method,
         and so on until they are caught or until they reach the very bottom of the call stack.
         This is called exception propagation.

when used throws : keyword we can handle it later

*************************************************************************

The Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception.
It gives an information to the programmer that there may occur an exception so it is better for the programmer
to provide the exception handling code so that normal flow can be maintained.

Now Checked Exception can be propagated (forwarded in call stack).

It provides information to the caller of the method about the exception.
